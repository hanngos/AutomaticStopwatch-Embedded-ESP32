# Description
The topic of this project is an automatic stopwatch (time measuring device), which aims to be used during a local competition. At the starting line, there is a sensor. Once the competitor has crossed it, the time count begins and continues until the competitor crosses the starting line a second time. Information about the time obtained by the competitor will be presented on the display. The stopwatch can be reset by pressing a button and is powered by an externally connected battery (PowerBank) for easy replacement of a discharged power source. The readiness of the device will be indicated by the LED (green when it is possible to start the race, red when the time is running, and blue when the time is finished but the device is not ready to count again).
